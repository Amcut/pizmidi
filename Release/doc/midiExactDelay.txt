midiExactDelay

Simple delay (no dry signal, no feedback) with flexible and precise delay time, measured in seconds, tempo-synced note values, or samples.


Parameters:

TimeMode - Choose the units of measurement (and corresponding parameters) to use for delay time: 
	Seconds - Absolute delay time, adjustable from 0.001 to 100.999 seconds
		using the Seconds/Tenths/Hundredths/Thousandths parameters.
	NoteValue - Tempo-based delay time, set by the Bars/Beats/NoteValue/Ticks parameters.
	Samples - Absolute delay time in samples, set by the the 1000/100/10/samples parameters.

Seconds - Adds 0-100 whole seconds to the delay time.
Tenths - Adds 0.0-0.9 seconds to the delay time.
Hundredths - Adds 0.0-0.09 seconds to the delay time.
Thousandths - Adds 0.0-0.009 seconds to the delay time.

Bars - Adds 0-32 bars (based on time signature) to the delay time.
Beats - Adds 0-32 beats (based on time signature) to the delay time.
NoteValue - Adds a musical note duration from a 128th note to a dotted half (set to "--" for 0 delay).
Ticks - Adds 0-100 ticks (960 ticks per quarter note) to the delay time. 

1000 samples - Adds 0-10000 samples in increments of 1000 to the delay time.
100 samples - Adds 0-900 samples in increments of 100 to the delay time.
10 samples - Adds 0-90 samples in increments of 10 to the delay time.
samples - Adds 0-9 samples to the delay time.

Output - Scale the values of output messages by this amount (0-100%).
	
Mode - Type of events to delay: Notes Only, Notes & CCs, or Everything.

Channel - MIDI channel on which to delay events; either "All" or 1-16.
