midiFingered

Selectively sends standard portamento on/off CC messages to emulate "fingered portamento" for synths that don't have it. For this to work, the target instrument must have a portamento on/off switch that responds to CC 65. 


Parameters:

Power - On/Off switch

Channel - MIDI channel, either "All" or 1-16.
