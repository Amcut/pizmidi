midiChordSplit

For splitting polyphonic material to multiple midi channels based on selected note ranges for each voice. This is different from a straight keyboard splitter because the ranges can overlap, and the plugin attempts to choose the most appropriate channel.


Global Parameters:

Power - On/Off switch for the whole plugin.

InChannel - Input channel.

NotePriority - How to decide which notes to end when polyphony limit is exceeded:
	Steal Oldest - The note with the oldest start time will be ended.
	Steal Last - The note with the most recent start time will be ended.
	Steal Quietest - The note with the lowest original velocity will be ended.
	High - Higher notes have priority, lowest pitched note will be ended.
	Low - Lower notes have priority, highest pitched note will be ended.
	Centered - Notes closest to the "center" (median) of held note have priority.
	Random - Note to steal is chosen at random.
	

Per-channel settings, with N from 1 to 16:

ChNPower - On/Off switch for channel N.

ChNLow - Lowest allowed note for channel N. Can't be set higher than ChNHigh.

ChNHigh - Highest allowed note for channel N. Can't be set lower than ChNLow. 

ChNPoly - Maximum number of notes allowed on channel N (1-64 notes).
