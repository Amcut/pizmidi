midiCCModulator

Use one CC to modulate another CC (or note velocity) in various ways.


Parameters:

Mode - Options:
    Off            - The plugin won't do anything
    CC -> CC       - Modulate a CC
    CC -> Velocity - Modulate the velocity of input MIDI notes

Input - The input CC to modulate, either "Any CC"/"Any Note" or 0-127

Modulator - The CC used to modulate the input, or "Manual" which uses a VST parameter instead of a CC

Manual - When Modulator is set to "Manual", this parameter is used as the modulator

Output - Output CC, either "Same as Input" or 0-127, ignored for "CC -> Velocity" mode

Amt/Thresh - Modulation amount, threshold, or nothing, depending on the ModType setting

ModType - The algorithm to apply to the Input and Modulator. Options:
    Invert - Simply inverts the input values, modulator is not used
    Add - Scales Modulator by Amt and adds it to Input, limited to 127 maximum output
    Average - Averages Input and Modulator, Amt crossfades between Input and the average
    WrapAdd - Same as Add, but values over 127 wrap around instead
    Subtract - Scales Modulator by Amt and subtracts it from Input, limited to 0 minimum output
    Add/Subtract - Like Add or Subtract, but treats Modulator as a bipolar value between -64 and +63
    Multiply - Normalizes Modulator to a maximum value of 2.0, scaled by Amt, and multiplies Input by it
    Compare - Outputs the higher of Input or Modulator
    Limit - Outputs the lower of Input or Modulator
    Bite - When Input is greater than Modulator, subtracts Modulator (scaled by Amt) from Input
    Mangle - When Input is less than Modulator, does a bipolar addition like Add/Subtract mode
    Gate - When Modulator is below Thresh, output is 0
    Block - When Modulator is at or above Thresh, output is 0
    AND - When both Modulator and Input are at or above Thresh, output is 127, otherwise 0
    NAND - When both Modulator and Input are at or above Thresh, output is 0, otherwise 127
    OR - When either Modulator or Input are at or above Thresh, output is 127, otherwise 0
    NOR - When either Modulator or Input are at or above Thresh, output is 0, otherwise 127
    XOR - When either Modulator or Input (but not both) are at or above Thresh, output is 127, otherwise 0
    XNOR - When either Modulator or Input (but not both) are at or above Thresh, output is 0, otherwise 127
    Match - When Modulator is equal to Input, output is 127, otherwise 0
    bitwise OR - Input | Modulator
    bitwise AND - Input & Modulator
    bitwise XOR - Input ^ Modulator
    << - Shifts the bits of Input left by Modulator amount
    >> - Shifts the bits of Input right by Modulator amount
    Randomize - Applies a random offset to Input between 0 and Modulator amount, scaled by Amt
	
OutLevel - Output level from 0-200%

Channel - MIDI Channel to listen on

Thru - What to do with MIDI messages other than the Input and Modulator
	Off - All incoming messages are blocked; only the output message is sent
	Block ModCC - All incoming messages are sent through, except the selected Modulator CC which is blocked
	All Thru - All incoming messages are sent through
