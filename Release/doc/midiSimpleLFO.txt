midiSimpleLFO

One CC LFO with some "simple" options.


Parameters:

Waveform - 
	Sawtooth - Descending linear ramp
	Ramp - Ascending linear ramp
	Triangle - Linear ramp up/down
	Square - Evenly-spaced high & low values only
	Sine - Sinusoidal
	Slow Random - Sends a random value once every cycle
	Fast Random - Sends a lot of random values every cycle
	
CC Out - CC number for the LFO output. Incoming events of this CC are blocked.

Channel Out - Channel for the LFO output.

Freq Mode - Options:
	Tempo - Frequency in musical times, based on host tempo.
	Hz - Frequency in Hz, independent of host tempo.
	
Frequency - In Tempo mode, 32 bars to 32nd note; In Hz mode, 0-27 Hz. At 0 Hz a single CC value will be sent only when triggered by a note (see Triggering modes).

Phase - Oscillator phase from -180 to +180 degrees. Can be modulated in real time.

Amplitude - Sets the LFO's output range, from 0 to 127. The range is centered at 63.

Offset - A constant added to all the values, from -64 to +63, for adjusting the "center line" of the waveform.

Triggering - Modes:
	Notes (Mono) - The LFO will start when a note is received, and will continue as long as any note is 
		playing.
	Notes (Poly) - The LFO will restart every time a note is received, and will continue as long as any note 
		is playing.
	Beat Sync - The LFO will be active only when the host is playing, and will be in sync with the host 
		timeline.
	Free Running - The LFO will be always active, independent of note input and host timeline.
	
Power - On/Off switch for the LFO.
