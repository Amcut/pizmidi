midiCCReset

Remembers CC values and sends them out again at selected times. 


Programs: Each VST program saves its own set of CCs (128 CCs x 16 channels), and these can optionally be sent when selecting a program. All VST parameters (except ManualTrig and Clear) are common to all programs.


Parameters:

ManualTrig - Move this parameter to maximum to manually send the saved CCs.

RecordTrig - When set to "On" the saved CC values will be sent when the host starts recording.

ProgramTrig - When set to "On" the saved CC values will be sent when changing programs on the plugin (either manually or with Program Change messages, if PC Listen is enabled).

Capture - When set to "On" any incoming CC events will be saved as the default values.

Clear - Move this parameter to maximum to clear any saved CC values.

Channel - MIDI channel to listen/send on. When set to "All" the plugin will store and send every CC on every channel (128x16 = 2048 values).

PC Listen - When "On" the plugin will respond to Program Change messages on the above selected channel.

Duplicates - Determines whether duplicate CC messages will be sent on preset change.
	Allow - Always send the whole preset
	Block - Only send the preset values that are different from the last output values
	
Thru - When "On" all incoming MIDI is passed through; otherwise it is blocked, and the triggered CCs are the only output from the plugin.
