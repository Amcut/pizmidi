midiAlias

Note values are reflected between a "Nyquist Note" and a "Zero Note," similar to the effect of audio sample aliasing.


Parameters:

Nyquist Note - The highest allowed note value. Input notes higher than this will be reflected downward.

Zero Note - The lowest allowed note value. Input notes lower than this will be reflected upward.

Pre Shift - Number of semitones to shift input notes before applying the reflection.

Power - Turns the plugin on or off.
