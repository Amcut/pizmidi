midiPolyphony

For spreading polyphony across midi channels, i.e. if you play 4 notes, each one will go to a different channel. Polyphony per channel can be set from 1 to 64 notes for more flexibility. You can also use it to convert polyphonic input to monophonic output. 


Parameters:

Power - On/Off switch for the effect.

LowChannel - First channel to route notes to.

HighChannel - Last channel to route notes to.

PolyPerChan - Maximum number of notes to be sent on each channel (1-64 notes).

NotePriority - How to decide which notes to end when polyphony limit is exceeded:
	Steal Oldest - The note with the oldest start time will be ended.
	Steal Last - The note with the most recent start time will be ended.
	Steal Quietest - The note with the lowest original velocity will be ended.
	High - Higher notes have priority, lowest pitched note will be ended.
	Low - Lower notes have priority, highest pitched note will be ended.
	Centered - Notes closest to the "center" (median) of held note have priority.
	Random - Note to steal is chosen at random.

Retrigger - When on, held notes that have been stolen (based on NotePriority) will be retriggered again when polyphony becomes available.

InChannel - Input channel.

SustainPedal - What to do with sustain pedal messages (CC 64) on the selected InChannel:
	Pass Thru - CC 64 will be sent to all channels between LowChannel and HighChannel
	Use - CC 64 will be used to sustain notes internally, and will not be sent through.
	
ChanMode - Options for determining how the channel for each note is chosen:
	Reuse - Lowest channel is always used until polyphony exceeds the PolyPerChan setting (old method). 
	Prefer New - Consecutive notes will cycle through the channels.
