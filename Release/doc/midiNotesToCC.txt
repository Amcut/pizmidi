midiNotesToCC

Converts note number and velocity to CC messages. 


Parameters:

Note to CC - Selects the destination CC number for note number conversion. The pitch of incoming notes will be used as the value of this CC. Set to "Off" to disable. 

High Note - The highest input note that will be used. This range acts as a filter for both note number and velocity conversion.

Low Note - The lowest input note that will be used.

High NCC Value - Highest possible output value for the note number CC. The incoming range defined by High Note & Low Note is stretched/compressed to this range.

Low NCC Value - Lowest possible output value for the note number CC.

NCC Rest Value - If enabled (not set to "Off") this value will be sent when a note-off is received. Only applies when Note to CC is also set.

Velocity to CC - Selects the destination CC number for velocity conversion. The velocity of incoming notes will be used as the value of this CC.

High Velocity - The highest input velocity that will be used (1-127). This range acts as a filter for both note number and velocity conversion.

Low Velocity - The lowest input velocity that will be used (1-127). 

High VCC Value - Highest possible output value for the velocity CC. The incoming range defined by High Velocity & Low Velocity is stretched/compressed to this range.

Low VCC Value - Lowest possible output value for the velocity CC.

VCC Rest Value - If enabled (not set to "Off") this value will be sent when a note-off is received. Only applies when Velocity to CC is also set.

In Channel - "Any" or 1-16.

Out Channel - Output CCs are sent on this channel, either "Same as input" or 1-16.

Thru - Options:
	Off - Only the output CCs will be sent.
	Unconverted - Unused MIDI messages will be sent through; only notes that have been converted are blocked.
	All - All MIDI messages will be sent through, including notes used for conversion.
