midiCCStepper

Quantize CC events by value or in time.


Parameters:

Val Quantize - On/Off switch for value quantization

ValQ Steps - Number of steps for value quantization. From 2 (CC values rounded to either 0 or 127) to 128 (no change)

Time Quantize - On/Off switch for time quantization

Note Value - Tempo-based value for time quantization, from 128 (128th note) to 1 (whole note)

Host Sync - For time quantization. When On, the note value quantization steps will be aligned to the host timeline. Otherwise the timing will be based only on input events. 

Beat Offset - Offset the quantization grid from the host timeline, from 0-100% of the Note Value. Only applies if Host Sync is On.

SendCCAfter - When enabled, CCs recieved after the time step are sent at the next time step.

Low CC - Lowest CC to affect; every CC from this one to High CC will be affected

High CC - Highest CC to affect

CC Shift - Changes the CC number of all affected CCs by this amount. For example, incoming CC 1 with CC Shift of 8 will be sent out as CC 9. Shift can be -127 to +127; numbers will wrap around.

Channel - MIDI Channel to listen on. Other channels are sent through unaffected.

NotesThru - Optionally block notes from being sent through the plugin.
